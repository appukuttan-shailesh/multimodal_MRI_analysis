# Surface analysis of fMRI data

- [ ] run fmriprep on cluster (slurm script and singularity code)
- [ ] test GLM in nilearn and compare with SPM
- [ ] parcellate data: workbench, nilearn?

The jupyter notebook `BRAINT_GLM.ipynb` shows how to smooth and run First level GLM on three kind of data:

- NIFTI
- GIFTI
- CIFTI

for the same run from the BRAINT project.

The jupyter notebooks `BRAINT_GLM-*.ipynb` show how to smooth and run First level GLM on three kind of data: NIFTI, GIFTI, CIFTI. Also for CIFTI, examples of parcellation with hcp-utils are shown.
